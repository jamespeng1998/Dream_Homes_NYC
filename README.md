# Dream_Homes_NYC
"Dream Homes NYC" is a real estate agency servicing the Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT), with multiple office locations in each state. They connect home sellers with potential buyers and home owners with potential renters. In other words, Dream Homes NYC clients can buy, rent, or sell homes (note: homes means single houses, townhouses, apartments, etc). The company employs both full-time and part-time agents. Dream Homes NYC wants to modernize their systems and build a database that will help them both organize their corporate data (offices, employees, expenses, profits, etc) and more importantly save all information on homes, clients, transactions, open houses, appointments, and anything else that can make them more efficient while improving the client experience.  Your team is hired to develop this new system. Dream Homes NYC leadership is even thinking about using the database to drive insights and perhaps build an app in the future.
